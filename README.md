In this lab I learned how to use the command line interface to use git. I learned about git statuses, ignoring files, wildcards, and cloning. 
<br>
Here is the code from lab 2
```javascript
/*
 CIT 281 Lab 2
 Name: Thomas Guthrie
*/
function square(num) {
    return num*num;
}
console.log('Square operations:')
for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i+=2) {
 console.log(`Square of ${i} is ${square(i)}`);
}

console.log(`Square of 20 is ${square(10)}`);
```
